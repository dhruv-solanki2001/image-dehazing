# Image-Dehazing
Implementation of the image dehazing process based on the paper [Single image dehazing via an improved atmospheric scattering model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307631122_Single_image_dehazing_via_an_improved_atmospheric_scattering_model)

The major components of the code are:
* Scene Luminance Map Estimation
* Scene Transmission Map Estimation
* Scene Transmission Map Edge Optimization
* Restored Image Scene Segmentation
* Reconstruction
